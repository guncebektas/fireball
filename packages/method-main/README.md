# Method

Method is an easy way to create Meteor `methods` with Optimistic UI. It's built with Meteor 3.0 in mind. It's meant to be a drop in replacement for [Validated Method](https://github.com/meteor/validated-method) and comes with additional features:

* Before and after hooks
* Global before and after hooks for all methods
* Pipe a series of functions
* Authed by default (can be overriden)
* Easily configure a rate limit
* Optionally run a method on the server only
* Attach the methods to Collections (optional)
* Validate with one of the supported schema packages or a custom validate function
* No need to use `.call` to invoke the method as with `Validated Methods`

## Usage

### Add the package to your app
`meteor add jam:method`

### Create a method
`name` is required and will be how Meteor's internals identifies it.

`schema` will automatically validate using a [supported schema](#supported-schemas).

`run` will be executed when the method is called.

```js
import { createMethod } from 'meteor/jam:method'; // can import { Methods } from 'meteor/jam:method' instead and use Methods.create if you prefer

export const create = createMethod({
  name: 'todos.create',
  schema: Todos.schema, // using jam:easy-schema in this example
  run({ text }) {
    const todo = {
      text,
      done: false,
      createdAt: new Date(),
      authorId: Meteor.userId(), // can also use this.userId instead of Meteor.userId()
    }
    const todoId = Todos.insert(todo);
    return todoId;
  }
});
```

#### Supported schemas
Currently, these schemas are supported:
* [jam:easy-schema](https://github.com/jamauro/easy-schema)
* [check](https://docs.meteor.com/api/check.html)
* [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)
* [simpl-schema](https://github.com/longshotlabs/simpl-schema)

Here's a quick example of each one's syntax. They vary in features so pick the one that best fits your needs.
```js
// jam:easy-schema. you'll attach to a Collection so you can reference one {Collection}.schema in your methods
const schema = {text: String, isPrivate: Optional(Boolean)}
// check
const schema = {text: String, isPrivate: Match.Maybe(Boolean)}
// zod
const schema = z.object({text: z.string(), isPrivate: z.boolean().optional()})
// simpl-schema
const schema = new SimpleSchema({text: String, isPrivate: {type: Boolean, optional: true}})
```

#### Custom validate function
If you're not using one of the supported schemas, you can use `validate` to pass in a custom validation function:
```js
// import your schema from somewhere
// import your validator function from somewhere

export const create = createMethod({
  name: 'todos.create',
  validate(args) {
    validator(args, schema)
  },
  run({ text }) {
    const todo = {
      text,
      done: false,
      createdAt: new Date(),
      authorId: Meteor.userId() // can also use this.userId instead of Meteor.userId()
    }
    const todoId = Todos.insert(todo);
    return todoId;
  }
});
```

### Async support
It also supports using `*Async` Collection methods, e.g.:
```js
export const create = createMethod({
  name: 'todos.create',
  schema: Todos.schema,
  async run({ text }) {
    const todo = {
      text,
      done: false,
      createdAt: new Date(),
      authorId: Meteor.userId() // can also use this.userId instead of Meteor.userId()
    }
    const todoId = await Todos.insertAsync(todo);
    return todoId;
  }
});
```

### Import on the client and use
```js
import { create } from '/imports/api/todos/methods';

async function submit() {
  try {
    await create({text: 'book flight to Hawaii'})
  } catch(error) {
    alert(error)
  }
}
```

### Before and after hooks
You can execute functions `before` and / or `after` the method's `run` function. `before` and `after` accept a single function or an array of functions.

When using `before`, the original input passed into the method will be available. The original input will be returned automatically from a `before` function so that `run` receives what was originally passed into the method.

A great use case for using `before` is to verify the user has permission. For example:

```js
async function checkOwnership({ _id }) { // the original input passed into the method is available here. destructuring for _id since that's all we need for this function
  const todo = await Todos.findOneAsync(_id);
  if (todo.authorId !== Meteor.userId()) {
    throw new Meteor.Error('not-authorized')
  }

  return true; // any code executed as a before function will automatically return the original input passed into the method so that they are available in the run function
}

export const markDone = createMethod({
  name: 'todos.markDone',
  schema: Todos.schema,
  before: checkOwnership,
  async run({ _id, done }) {
    return await Todos.updateAsync(_id, {$set: {done}});
  }
});
```

When using `after`, the result of the `run` function will be available as the first argument and the second argument will contain the original input that was passed into the method. The result of the `run` function will be automatically returned from an `after` function.

```js
function exampleAfter(result, context) {
  const { originalInput } = context; // the name of the method is also available here
  // do stuff

  return 'success'; // any code executed as an after function will automatically return the result of the run function
}

export const markDone = createMethod({
  name: 'todos.markDone',
  schema: Todos.schema,
  before: checkOwnership,
  async run({ _id, done }) {
    return await Todos.updateAsync(_id, {$set: {done}});
  },
  after: exampleAfter
});
```

**`Note`**: If you use arrow functions for `before`, `run`, or `after`, you'll lose access to `this` â€“ the methodInvocation. You may be willing to sacrifice that because `this.userId` can be replaced by `Meteor.userId()` and `this.isSimulation` can be replaced by `Meteor.isClient` but it's worth noting.


### Pipe a series of functions
Instead of using `run`, you can compose functions using `.pipe`. Each function's output will be available as an input for the next function.

```js
// you'd define the functions in the pipe and then place them in the order you'd like them to execute within .pipe
// be sure that each function in the pipe returns what the next one expects, otherwise you can add an arrow function to the pipe to massage the data, e.g. (input) => manipulate(input)

export const create = createMethod({
  name: 'todos.create',
  schema: Todos.schema
}).pipe(
  checkOwnership,
  createTodo,
  sendNotification
)
```

### Attach methods to its Collection (optional)
Instead of importing each method, you can attach them to the Collection. If you're using [jam:easy-schema](https://github.com/jamauro/easy-schema) be sure to attach the schema before attaching the methods.

```js
// /imports/api/todos/collection
import { Mongo } from 'meteor/mongo';
import { schema } from './schema';

export const Todos = new Mongo.Collection('todos');

Todos.attachSchema(schema); // if you're using jam:easy-schema
(async() => {
  const methods = await import('./methods.js') // dynamic import is recommended
  Todos.attachMethods(methods);
})();
```

With the methods attached you'll use them like this on the client:
```js
import { Todos } from '/imports/api/todos/collection';
// no need to import each method individually

async function submit() {
  try {
    await Todos.create({text: 'book flight to Hawaii'})
  } catch(error) {
    alert(error)
  }
}
```

#### Automatically dynamic import attached methods (optional)
You can also automatically dynamic import your attached methods to reduce the initial bundle size on the client.

You'll need to add a file to your project, e.g. `/imports/register-dynamic-imports.js` and import this file on both the client and the server near the top of its `mainModule`, e.g. `/client/main.js` and `/server/main.js`. Here's an example of the file:

```js
// In order for the dynamic import to work properly, Meteor needs to know these paths exist.
// We do that by declaring them statically inside a if (false) block
Meteor.startup(async () => {
  if (false) {
    await import('/imports/api/todos/schema'); // if using jam:easy-schema and want to dyanmically import it
    await import('/imports/api/todos/methods');
    // add additional method paths for your other collections here
  }
});
```

Then instead of using `Todos.attachMethods(methods)`, you'd just use `Todos.attachMethods()`
```js
// /imports/api/todos/collection
// By not passing in the methods explicitly, it will automatically dynamically import the methods and then attach them

import { Mongo } from 'meteor/mongo';

export const Todos = new Mongo.Collection('todos');

Todos.attachSchema(); // assuming you're using jam:easy-schema and dynamically importing it too
Todos.attachMethods();
```

This assumes your directory structure is `/imports/api/{collection}/methods`. If you have a different structure, e.g. `/api/todos/methods`, you can configure the base path with:
```js
import { Methods } from 'meteor/jam:method';

Methods.configure({
  basePath: `/api`
});
```

### Executing code on the server only
By default, methods are optimistic meaning they will execute on the client and then on the server. If there's only part of the method that should execute on the server and not on the client, then simply wrap that piece of code in a `if (Meteor.isServer)` block. This way you can still maintain the benefits of Optimistic UI. For example:

```js
export const create = createMethod({
  name: 'todos.create',
  schema: Todos.schema,
  async run(args) {
    // rest of your function
    // code running on both client and server
    if (Meteor.isServer) {
      // code running on the server only
      import { secretCode } from '/server/secretCode'; // since it's in a /server folder the code will not be shipped to the client
      // do something with secretCode
    }

    // code running on both client and server
    return Todos.insertAsync(todo)
  }
});
```

If you prefer, you can force the entire method to execute on the server only by setting `serverOnly: true`. It can be used with `run` or `.pipe`. Here's an example with `run`:

```js
export const create = createMethod({
  name: 'todos.create',
  schema: Todos.schema,
  serverOnly: true,
  async run(args) {
    // all code here will execute only on the server
  }
});
```

You can also set all methods to be `serverOnly`. See [Configuring](#configuring-optional) below.

#### Security note
**`Important`**: Since Meteor does not currently support tree shaking, the contents of the code inside `run` function or `.pipe` could still be visible to the client even if you use `if (Meteor.isServer)` or `serverOnly: true`. To prevent this, you have these options:

1. Attach methods to its Collection with a dynamic import as shown above [Attach methods to its Collection (optional)](#attach-methods-to-its-collection-optional)

2. Import function(s) from a file within a `/server` folder. Any code imported from a `/server` folder will not be shipped to the client. The `/server` folder can be located anywhere within your project's file structure and you can have multiple `/server` folders. For example, you can co-locate with your collection folder, e.g. `/imports/api/todos/server/`, or it can be at the root of your project. See [Secret server code](https://guide.meteor.com/security.html#secret-code) for more info.

```js
export const create = createMethod({
  name: 'todos.create',
  schema: Todos.schema,
  serverOnly: true,
  async run(args) {
    import { serverFunction } from '/server/serverFunction';

    serverFunction(args);
  }
});
```

3. Dynamically import function(s). These do not have to be inside a `/server` folder. This will prevent the code being inspectable via the browser console.

```js
export const create = createMethod({
  name: 'todos.create',
  schema: Todos.schema,
  serverOnly: true,
  async run(args) {
    const { serviceFunction } = await import('./services');

    serviceFunction(args);
  }
});
```

### Changing authentication rules
By default, all methods will be protected by authentication, meaning they will throw an error if there is *not* a logged-in user. You can change this for an individual method by setting `isPublic: true`. See [Configuring](#configuring-optional) below to change it for all methods.

```js
export const create = createMethod({
  name: 'todos.create',
  schema: Todos.schema,
  isPublic: true,
  async run({ text }) {
    // ... //
  }
});
```

### Rate limiting
Easily rate limit a method by setting its max number of requests â€“ the `limit` â€“ within a given time period (milliseconds) â€“ the `interval`.

```js
export const create = createMethod({
  name: 'todos.create',
  schema: Todos.schema,
  rateLimit: { // rate limit to a max of 5 requests every second
    limit: 5,
    interval: 1000
  },
  async run({ text }) {
    // ... //
  }
});
```

### Options for Meteor.applyAsync
When called, the method uses [Meteor.applyAsync](https://docs.meteor.com/api/methods#Meteor-applyAsync) under the hood to execute your `run` function or `.pipe` function(s). `Meteor.applyAsync` takes a few options which can be used to alter the way Meteor handles the method. If you want to change the defaults or include other supported options, pass in `options` when creating the method.

```js
export const create = createMethod({
  name: 'todos.create',
  schema: Todos.schema,
  options: {
    // ... //
  },
  async run({ text }) {
    // ... //
  }
});
```

By default, this package uses the following `options`:
```js
{
  // Make it possible to get the ID of an inserted item
  returnStubValue: true,

  // Don't call the server method if the client stub throws an error, so that we don't end
  // up doing validations twice
  throwStubExceptions: true,
};
```
See [Configuring](#configuring-optional) below to set `options` for all methods.

## Configuring (optional)
If you like the defaults, then you won't need to configure anything. But there is some flexibility in how you use this package.

Here are the global defaults:
```js
const config = {
  before: [], // global before function(s) that will run before all methods
  after: [], // global after function(s) that will run after all methods
  serverOnly: false, // globally make all methods serverOnly, aka disable Optimistic UI, by setting to true
  options: {
    returnStubValue: true, // make it possible to get the ID of an inserted item on the client before the server finishes
    throwStubExceptions: true,  // don't call the server method if the client stub throws an error, so that we don't end up doing validations twice
  },
  arePublic: false, // by default all methods will be protected by authentication, override it for all methods by setting this to true
  basePath: `/imports/api`, // used when dynamically importing methods
  loggedOutError: new Meteor.Error('logged-out', 'You must be logged in') // customize the logged out error
};
````

To change the global defaults, use:
```js
// put this in a file that's imported on both the client and server
import { Methods } from 'meteor/jam:method';

Methods.configure({
  // ... change the defaults here ... //
});
```

### Global before and after hooks
You can create before and/or after functions to run before / after all methods. Both `before` and `after` accept a single function or an array of functions.

```js
import { Methods } from 'meteor/jam:method';

const hello = () => { console.log('hello') }
const there = () => { console.log('there') }
const world = () => { console.log('world') }

Methods.configure({
  before: [hello, there],
  after: world
});
```

### Helpful utility functions
Here are some helpful utility functions you might consider adding. They aren't included in this package but you can copy and paste them into your codebase where you see fit.

*Logger*
```js
// log will simply console.log or console.error when the Method finishes
function log(input, pipeline) {
  pipeline.onResult((result) => {
    console.log(`Method ${pipeline.name} finished`, input);
    console.log('Result', result);
  });

  pipeline.onError((err) => {
    console.error(`Method ${pipeline.name} failed`);
    console.error('Error', err);
  });
};
```

*Server-only function*
```js
// this will ensure that the function passed in will only run on the server
// could come in handy if have you're using .pipe and some of the functions you want to ensure only run on the server
function server(fn) {
  return function(...args) {
    if (Meteor.isServer) {
      return fn(...args)
    }
  }
};
```

Then you could use them like this:
```js
Methods.configure({
  after: server(log)
});
```

## Coming from `Validated Method`?
You may be familiar with `mixins` and wondering where they are. With the features of this package - authenticated by default, `before` / `after` hooks, `.pipe` - your mixin code may no longer be needed or can be simplified. If you have another use case where your mixin doesn't translate, I'd love to hear it. Open a new discussion and let's chat.
