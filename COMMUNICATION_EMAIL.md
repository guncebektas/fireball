# EFFECTIVE EMAIL COMMUNICATION
To ensure our email communication is as effective and efficient as possible, 
we'd like to share some guidelines to help streamline our exchanges and 
reduce the clutter in our inboxes.

These "rules of thumb" are designed to improve 
clarity, reduce email overload, and enhance our overall productivity.

Let’s work together to make our inboxes a better-managed space 
with communication that is clear, concise, and actionable.

## Descriptive Subjects: 
Start with a clear subject line, summarizing the email's intent to 
facilitate quick understanding and future searches. 
Change / update email subjects if you switch to another topic.

### Targeted Recipients: 
Address emails only to individuals directly involved in the action or 
decision-making process. Think carefully as the originator of the email 
to only add the necessary people.

## Concise 'CC' Use: 
Use 'CC' thoughtfully. Include only those who need awareness of 
the information without the need for direct action.

## Conciseness Counts: 
Keep the content concise. Lengthy discussions should be taken 
offline into meetings.

## Clear Action Items: 
Clearly state required actions, use bullet points for visibility, 
and include deadlines where applicable.

## Action Point Timelines: 
When an action is assigned to you, confirm receipt with an estimated time
for the addressed action or a detailed response.

## Summary for Newcomers: 
Provide context when adding new recipients to a thread, 
with a brief summary of the discussion so far.

## Use 'Reply All' Sparingly: 
Consider whether all recipients need to see your response to 
avoid cluttering inboxes. Don’t reply with “thanks”, “I agree” 
and other noise that doesn’t add anything. 
When replying think about options, is reply all really appropriate, 
could the bulk of people be moved to bcc.

## Prioritise Privacy: 
Handle sensitive content with care.

## Feedback and Suggestions: 
Let's keep each other accountable and share feedback with 
each other to continuously improve our e-mail communication practices.
