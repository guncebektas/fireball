# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds German language translation support to the Pablo Coffee Go application. The application currently supports Turkish (tr-TR) and English (en-US) languages, and we need to extend this to include German (de-DE) to serve German-speaking customers and expand the application's reach in German-speaking markets.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a German-speaking user, I want to view the application interface in German, so that I can navigate and use the application comfortably in my native language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects German from the language selector THEN the entire application interface SHALL display in German
2. WHEN the application loads with German as the selected language THEN all text elements SHALL be rendered in German
3. WHEN a user switches to German language THEN the language preference SHALL be persisted for future sessions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a German-speaking user, I want to see German as an available language option in the language selector, so that I can easily switch to my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the language selector modal THEN German SHALL appear as one of the available language options
2. WHEN German is displayed in the language selector THEN it SHALL show the German flag icon and "Deutsch" as the language label
3. WHEN a user clicks on the German language option THEN the interface SHALL immediately switch to German
4. WHEN German is the current language THEN the language selector SHALL display the German flag in the navigation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the German language configuration to be properly integrated into the application settings, so that the feature works seamlessly with the existing internationalization system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN German SHALL be included in the supportedLanguages configuration
2. WHEN a user's browser language is set to German THEN the application SHALL automatically detect and use German as the default language
3. WHEN the German translation file is updated THEN the changes SHALL be reflected in the application without requiring a restart
4. IF the German translation file has syntax errors THEN the application SHALL log appropriate error messages and fallback gracefully
